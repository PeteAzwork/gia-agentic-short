# Known Issues

Tracked issues discovered during workflow runs. These should be converted to GitHub issues for formal tracking.

## Critical: Edison List Response Bug (FIXED)

**Status:** Fixed in commit `5398706`

Edison's `arun_tasks_until_done` returns a **LIST** of `PQATaskResponse` objects, not a single object. The code was doing `getattr(task_response, 'answer', str(task_response))` but since lists don't have an `answer` attribute, this fell back to `str(task_response)` which gave the repr string of the entire list, causing citation extraction to fail.

## Open Issues

### 1. Literature Synthesis NoneType Error

**Severity:** High  
**Error:** `Literature synthesis failed: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`  
**Root Cause:** When `citations` is empty (due to Edison bug), downstream code tries to subscript `None`  
**Location:** `src/agents/literature_synthesis.py`  
**Fix needed:** Add null checks for citations before accessing  

### 2. Analysis Execution Missing Scripts

**Severity:** Medium  
**Error:** `Analysis execution failed: No analysis scripts configured or discovered under analysis/`  
**Root Cause:** The workflow expects analysis scripts in `analysis/` folder but none exist for this project  
**Location:** `src/agents/literature_workflow.py` analysis execution step  
**Fix needed:** Either:
- Skip analysis step when no scripts exist (current behavior is to error)
- Or mark as non-blocking warning instead of error

### 3. Consistency Issues Between Documents

**Severity:** Low (cosmetic)  
**Count:** 15 critical, 23 high, 3 medium consistency issues  
**Root Cause:** `RESEARCH_OVERVIEW.md` and `UPDATED_RESEARCH_OVERVIEW.md` have divergent definitions for:
- Hypothesis H1 wording differs slightly
- Week schedules differ (Week 1: "Data fixes" vs "Literature review")
- Hour allocations differ between documents

**Fix needed:** These are content issues, not code bugs. The consistency checker is correctly identifying real inconsistencies in the generated documents. This should be addressed by the document generation agents producing more consistent output.
